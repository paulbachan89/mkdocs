## Let's talk about DNS

**DNS** stand for the **Domain Naming System** and it's a critical system of any Networking and Server operations. Without DNS our internet will cease to exist, or really it will be really complicated. I'm sure you've used the internet many. Think about how you use the internet, you navigate to a website like **www.google.com** or **www.microsoft.com** or even, **www.learn.microsoft.com**. Using these names we can easily navigate to the website of our choice. This is prehaps the most popular way we can see DNS being used.
