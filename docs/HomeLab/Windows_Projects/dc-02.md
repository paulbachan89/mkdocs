## Building a Secondary Domain Controller

In the previous section we created a New Domain Controller called: DC-01 you can find that setup here: [DC-01](dc-01.md). Now we're going to be creating a new domain controller. I've essentially built a new Domain Controller called: DC-02 following the same methods I did in this page: [Windows Server Installation](Windows_Server_Install\WinSrvInstall.md). The only things I changed here where was the name of the Virtual Machine, the Hostname and the IP address where I used: 

- **IP address**: 192.168.100.21
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
- **Gateway**: 192.168.100.254
- **DNS Server 1**: 192.168.100.20
- **DNS Server 2**: 192.168.100.21


You might have noticed that I used DC-01 as the DNS Server 1 and DC-02 will be the secondary DNS Server. If you're think that you prefer to use google's DNS at 8.8.8.8. Let's see why that won't work for you.

So we currently have an Active Directory Domain. Awesome right, but how do we use it and what does that mean really? Currently inside of our Active Directory Domain we only have 1 server within our Domain and that it DC-01. Which means we can only manage DC-01 and any user accounts that we create can only log into DC-01. Which is not very useful at the moment but we'll change that. We'll add DC-02 to our prblabs.ca domain. Here's how we do that but first, I changed my DNS settings on DC-02 to be the following.

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-1.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-1.jpg)

Notice I have my DNS servers set to 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. These are what you call: Public DNS Servers. Which means anyone can use this to get out to the internet. 

Now to add DC-02 to my prblabs.ca Domain. First I open up Server Manager and go to Local Computer then I click on Computer Name: **dc-02** 

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-2.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-2.jpg)

Then I click on **Change**

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-3.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-3.jpg)

And under **Member of** I change this from **Workgroup** to a **Domain** and I enter **prblabs.ca** in the Domain field:

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-4.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-4.jpg)

And I will then click **OK** and spoiler alert there is going to be an error message:

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-5.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-5.jpg)

Now the reason why this gave us an error message is because we have our DNS entries set to: 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. And because of that, we cannot contact DC-01 to join the domain. 

Here's a few test:

Can I ping DC-01 IP address 192.168.100.20:

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-6.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-6.jpg)

The answer is yes, but what this means is that they are in the same network so yes they can communicate with each, but when it comes to name resolution. dc-01's domain name is dc-01.prblabs.ca, DC-02 knows go to get to 192.168.100.20 because our gateway handles that but when it comes to name resolution, we are relying on Google's and Cloudflare's DNS which does not know what DC-01 is and what it's IP address is. We can see that by trying the following command in CMD:

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-7.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-7.jpg)

nslookup is a command that we can use to tell us what the IP address of a DNS entry like google.com and Microsoft.com. You can see we can get information on google.com but not one dc-01.prblabs.ca. The fix this we need a DNS server that can resolve the hostname dc-01.prblabs.ca and lucky for us we do have a DNS server that can do that. It's DC-01.

So we'll change our DNS IP address as the following:

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-8.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-8.jpg)

Alright, let's try out nslookup command again.

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-9.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-9.jpg)

There is a DNS request timed out message, but we were able to resolve dc-01.prblabs.ca to 192.168.100.20. Perfect. let's trying adding DC-02 to our Domain now.

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-10.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-10.jpg)

If a Windows Security box comes up for you to enter your username and password, that's means we're able to contact DC-01 to join the domain. From here, we need to enter a **Domain Account** credential for authentications. This is important. Domain Accounts and objects that are created within Active Directory. When we first promoted DC-01 to be a domain controller our Administrator account got converted to a domain account. So we can use that, but we also created a user account called: **prbadmin**. I will use this but you can use something else. Again, the user account you created on DC-02 will not work. Only a Domain Account is needed here.

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-11.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-11.jpg)

Once I enter my domain admin credential here I will click **OK**

If you see **Welcome to the prblabs.ca domain** it means you were successful, if you had a incorrect user name and password, it means there is something wrong with your credentials. If you got an insufficient permission message it means that your user account does not have the necessary rights to add a computer to a domain. You can resolve this by adding your user account to the domain admins security group.

Once you're done and it's working you can click **OK**

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-12.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-12.jpg)

Then it will tell you that you need to restart for it to take effect. Click **OK**

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-13.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-13.jpg)

After that you can click **Close** 

[![Select creation type](dc-02_install/dc02-14.jpg)](dc-02_install/dc02-14.jpg)

On the System Properties box and there is will ask you if you want to reboot, I will click restart now.
