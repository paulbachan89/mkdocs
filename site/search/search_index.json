this project is to explore the world of Microsoft Windows Server. See, what it can do and how it integrates with other systems out there. </p> <p>Firstly, let's get a few things out of the way. What is Windows Server? I go through this in more details in my Overview discussion. However, Windows Server is an operating system that's mainly targeted to Business and Enterprise customers. Unlike Microsoft Windows 8, 10 and 11 which is targeted towards consumers and users, Windows Server exist to server these operating System. Windows Server is unqiue in the idea that it can become something like a Domain Controller, File Server, VPN Server or a Remote Desktop Server. Sure you can install Jellyfin or something else on your Windows computer that makes it into a server but Windows Servers are specifically designed to carry out these roles. Windows Server comes pre-baked with all kinds of roles and features that you can use to accomplish a given task.</p> <p>My goal for this project is to somewhat re-educate myself on Windows Server and with the newly released Windows Server 2025, I think it's a great time to start. </p> <p>So before we get the our installation, let's get a few thing out of the way. What am I install Windows Server on and what does my networking looks like?</p> <p>So I'll be use VMWare ESXi as my host, but you can use any Virtualization platform you're comfortable with.

My Gateway is my home router. It's a Mikrotik Router. It's currently setup in Bridge Mode so my public IP address is managed on my router. The OPNSense-Router there is actually a Virtual Machine on my ESXi Server. I choose to use another router because my Mikrotik Router handles all the routing for my personal devices, so I prefer to have a separate network for all of my Windows Server since some servers can be chatty. Also, I don't need to worry about conflicting IP addresses within my Networking, I can just freely assigned any IP address I choose to whichever server I feel will be best. Since I am double NAT, I will need to add a few networking rules here and there to ensure that I can communication back and forth between the 10.10.10.0/24 and the 192.168.100.0/24 network.</p> <p>If you're interested you can see how I setup my opnsense router here.</p> <p>This is what my networking looks like:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/Welcome/","title":"Welcome","text":""},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/Welcome/#this-project-is-all-about-windows-server","title":"This Project is all about Windows Server","text":"<p>I will be building some  domain controllers and other Windows Server and make create an awesome Infrastruct.</p>"},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/dc01/","title":"DC-01","text":"<p>DC-01 is a Domain Controller running Windows Server.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/dc01/#configuration","title":"Configuration","text":"<ul> <li>Operating System: Windows Server 2019</li> <li>Role: Domain Controller</li> <li>IP Address: 192.168.50.20</li> <li>Active Directory Version: 2019</li> </ul>"},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/opnsense/","title":"OPNsense Install","text":""},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/opnsense/#opnsense-router-setup","title":"OPNSense Router Setup","text":"<p>This is an optional step if you're following allowing. The Idea behind this router is to give me my own seperate subnet for me to play with, without having to worry about conflicting IP addresses or an IP address that I would like to use but is already in use. The opnsense router is a simple setup except for a new Firewall Rules that will allow me to communication with my main subnet.</p> <p>First thing we'll want to do is to download the ISO for opnsense. It can be found here: </p> <p>Download OPNSense</p> <p>Perfect. I'm going to be uploading the OPNSense ISO File to my VMware ESXi Storage repository. Depending on where you are performing your installation, you'll need to ensure that your Virtual Machine is able to access the ISO since you'll need to mount it.</p> <p>First thing I will do will be to create my Virtual Machine for OPNSense</p> <ul> <li>In ESXi, I click Create/Register VM and then at the Select creation type I choose Create a new virtual Machine</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Next we will need to Select a name and Guest OS. I will choose the easy name and just call it opnsense-router for the guest OS I want to ensure that I choose the following:</p> <ul> <li>Compatibilty - ESXi 8.0 U2 virtual machine</li> <li>Guest OS family - Other</li> <li>Guest OS version - FreeBSD 14 or later versions (64-bit)</li> </ul> <p>The Guest OS version is important here because if you choose something else, your opnsense vm or installation might not go through because of the different driver options.</p> <p></p> <p>Select storage is the next option. I have a few different hard drives to choose from so I'll just choose: DS1-1TB</p> <p></p> <p>Here is the more important settings to choose. The Customize settings option is where we will choose how much resources we would like to give to our opnsense router.</p> <p>For me I will assigned to following resources:</p> <ul> <li>CPU = 2 vCPU</li> <li>Memory = 2GB</li> <li>Hard Drive = 30GB</li> <li>Network Adapter 1</li> <li>Network Adapter 2</li> </ul> <p>Since this is a router, it will need two networking adapter. One for the WAN traffic to talk out to the internet and the other for the LAN traffic where my Windows Servers will exist.</p> <p>For my adapter settings. I basically create an internal network that is not able to talk to the main network (10.10.10.0/24), instead I want this network to go through the WAN interface. </p> <p>You can ignore my naming scheme for my network Prod-Net is on the 10.10.10.0/24 network and PGroup19100 is on the 192.168.100.0/24 network. Of course, the name you gave your network makes a lot more sense that mine.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you're done with this section you can click Next then Finish</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/opnsense/#installing-opnsense","title":"Installing OPNsense","text":"<p>Okay, so we've just completed creating our Virtual Machine, next up we will need to install opnsense on the Virtual Machine that we've just created.</p> <p>In my ESXi host, I'm going to click on my newly create Virtual Machine called: opnsense-router and Start it up</p> <p></p> <p>You will see a very quick boot screen that gives you about 5 seconds to pause if needed. If your opnsense VM does not boot, you have an issue with the ISO image, try downloading it again maybe trying DVD instead of VGA or another option that it provides. It could also be your Virutal DVD drive is not being detected on your because you did not choose the correct Guest OS version.</p> <p>If it does boot successfully, you will see a screen like this:</p> <p></p> <p>You might have noticed that LAN is assigned to VMX0 and WAN is assigned to VMX1. The LAN has an IP address of 192.168.1.1/24 but there is nothing assigned to WAN. The reason this happened is because opnsense automatically assigned out interfaces for us, but to worry, we do not need to use the default settings that is applied to us. We can change this and many other settings as we go further. For now, we are going to install OPNSense on our virtual machine. To do that, at the screen we're currently on. If you've took the time to read you notice that it tells you what to do. You can sign into the live mode where you can make changes and configure the router but please note that changes made here will not survive a reboot. To ensure that our changes are kept we will need to install it. We do that by typing installer as the username and opnsense as the password. Once we do that the installation process begins:</p> <p>First thing, we need choose a Keymap Selection I will go with the default keymap but you can choose the one that works best for you:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Next it will ask me to select the Virtual Device Type. Here I will choose stripe. I will assigned one hard drive to my opnsense installation so that's all I can do. Since this is just a test lab. I do not need to added security of having a mirror or a different RAID setup in the event of a drive failure. Stripe will work in my situation.</p> <p></p> <p>Next it's going to ask me to confirm which hard drive I will like to install opnsense on. I only have one option so I will press my spacebar to select the device then click OK</p> <p></p> <p>It warns me that the data on the disk is about the get destoryed, since this is a new disk that doesn't contain any data I will say yes.</p> <p></p> <p>Click yes will begin the installation:</p> <p></p> <p>If thers is any issues with the hardware you select, this will be where you will see it. It will error out and will stop the installation process. If this happens to you and you're using a physical hardware, ensure that the hardware you're using is compatible with OPNSense. For Virtual Machines, the biggest roadblock here is your hard drive. Ensure you have the correct Hard Drive Controller. For my installation I had VMWare Paravirtual selected as my SCSI Controller 0. If everything goes well, you will see this screen:</p> <p>If you would like to, you can change your root password here but I will complete install and reboot.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/Windows_Server_Install/WinSrvInstall/","title":"Windows Server Installation","text":""},{"location":"HomeLab/Windows_Projects/Windows_Server_Install/WinSrvInstall/#here-i-will-be-showing-you-how-to-install-a-windows-server","title":"Here I will be showing you how to install a Windows Server","text":""},{"location":"blog/","title":"Welcome","text":""},{"location":"blog/#welcome-to-my-blog","title":"Welcome to my Blog!","text":""},{"location":"blog/posts/firstp/","title":"Project 1","text":""},{"location":"blog/posts/firstp/#this-is-my-first-project","title":"This is my first project.","text":"<p>With this Project I will attempt to create a Windows labs.</p>"}]}
